How to run this example:
1.	Run Ariadne from Python's IDLE
2.	When asked for a path+name, write down "Example_constantShift/Cuaderno_index", without the quotation marks
3.	That should create the file "Cuaderno_extragal_vipena_indexed.pdf" within this same folder, where the indices and
	section hierarchy have been scripted as detailed in Cuaderno_index.txt

*compare the second-to last line from Cuaderno_index in this example and in that within the Example_varyingShift folder, and
how the line starting by an exclamation mark affects the PDF page onto which the section "El medio intrac√∫mulo" is indexed.
